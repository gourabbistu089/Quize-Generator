MCQ,Choices,Correct
What is the primary goal of Machine Learning?,"a: To write explicit rules for every possible scenario a machine might encounter. | b: To enable machines to learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit rule-based programming. | c: To store and organize vast amounts of information for manual analysis. | d: To create machines that only perform repetitive, simple calculations.",b
"In which type of machine learning do algorithms learn from datasets that have corresponding target outputs, often called 'labels'?",a: Unsupervised Learning | b: Reinforcement Learning | c: Supervised Learning | d: Exploratory Data Analysis,c
"Which machine learning task involves grouping data points based on their similarities, such as segmenting customers into different behavioral groups, without any pre-defined labels?",a: Classification | b: Regression | c: Clustering | d: Feature Engineering,c
"What problem occurs when a machine learning model becomes too complex and learns noise from the training data instead of just the meaningful patterns, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data?",a: Underfitting | b: Generalization | c: Overfitting | d: Bias,c
How does an agent in Reinforcement Learning primarily learn to achieve its objective?,"a: By being provided with a complete dataset of correct actions and outcomes. | b: Through trial and error, interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. | c: By having a human expert program all possible decision rules. | d: By simply memorizing all previously encountered data points.",b
